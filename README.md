# MassMap


MassMap automates port scanning of large target IP addresses and/or CIDR notations by combining Masscan's speed, and Nmap's detailed scanning features. 

## How it Works
1. MassMap updates the machine, and then checks if it has the latest versions of Masscan and Nmap. If not, MassMap installs them.
2. Masscan then performs a scan on **all 65535 TCP ports** against the list of target IP addresses and/or CIDR notations. The results are stored in an HTML file under the `results` directory. 
3. Using the open ports identified by Masscan, an Nmap version and script scans gets executed against the hosts which have open ports. The results are also written in the `results` diretory. Two HTML files are created: one uses Nmap's default XLS stylesheet, while the other one uses [honze's bootstrap stylesheet](https://github.com/honze-net/nmap-bootstrap-xsl/).


## How to Use
```
git clone https://github.com/capt-meelo/MassMap.git
cd MassMap
chmod +x massmap.sh
./massmap.sh <target_file>
```

## Notes
- It's suggested to run this tool in a VPS, such as [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=f7f86614e1b3), for better speed & accuracy.
- Running this tool takes time, thus it's recommended to run it under a **screen** or **tmux** session.
- By default, **Masscan** runs using the option `--rate 100000` for more accurate results. If you want **Masscan** to run faster, increase the `--rate` option.
